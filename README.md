# WAVE RIDER | SURF SHOP

E-commerce Progressive Web App

A website I built to practice a bunch of technologies:

## Tech Stack

- NextJS 14
- Scss
- Typecript
- Redux
- Google Maps API
- Stripe API / payment gateway
- Supabase (hosting my database)
- EmailJS
- Framer Motion

The app is progressive, it means that:

- You can download it from compatible browsers and use it like a native app
- You can run it while offline
- Essential data is cached so it loads the content faster

## Getting Started

Open a terminal, travel to you desired location on your machine using:

```bash
cd nameOfyourLocation
```

Clone the project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thomasaugot/wave-rider-ecommerce.git
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
